# Reading data from a csv file
# You can read data from a CSV file using the `read_csv` function. By default, it assumes that the fields are comma-separated.

# We're going to be looking at some cyclist data from Montréal. Here's the [original page](http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/dataset/velos-comptage) (in French), but it's already included in this repository. We're using the data from 2012.

# This dataset is a list of how many people were on 7 different bike paths in Montreal, each day.
pl_broken_df = pl.read_csv("C:/Users/73631/OneDrive/桌面/pandas_to_polars_cookbook/data/bikes.csv", encoding="ISO-8859-1")

# %%
# Look at the first 3 rows
pl_broken_df.head(3)

# %%
# You'll notice that this is totally broken! `read_csv` has a bunch of options that will let us fix that, though. Here we'll

# * change the column separator to a `;`
# * Set the encoding to `'latin1'` (the default is `'utf8'`)
# * Parse the dates in the 'Date' column
# * Tell it that our dates have the day first instead of the month first
# * Set the index to be the 'Date' column

pl_fixed_df = pl.read_csv(
    "C:/Users/73631/OneDrive/桌面/pandas_to_polars_cookbook/data/bikes.csv",

# Selecting a column

# Plotting is quite easy in Polars using Matplotlib and Seaborn
sns.lineplot(data=pl_fixed_df.to_pandas(), x="Date", y="Berri 1")
plt.show()

# We can also plot all the columns just as easily. We'll make it a little bigger, too.
